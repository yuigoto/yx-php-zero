YX : PHP : _0 (ZERO) 
====================

> _0 (ZERO) is a "small" code library I built to use on my own projects.

This is a collection of code I've written and used since I started writing PHP code in 2009. The "library" exists as a proper collection since 2010, when I made my first flat-file CMS.

From then, the code inside this library grew up, it changed names, some stuff became obsolete (and I'm sure some of it is still obsolete) and experimental stuff found its way into the code, but it proved useful to me, so it might be for you (or not).

Most of the stuff I wrote as an exercise, so things might not always be the best solution out there, I advise you to research a bit, when in doubt.
